## Backlog

-Prompt text is cut off for all “Type your answer here…” responses (attached)
-“climate change” should not be capitalized like the attached
-On the final page that shows the results, I also feel like the text of the dollar amounts and the “offset what you want” should be bigger and it will look more emphasized and slicker. But I realize this might not work on places like mobile so I’ll leave it to your discretion on what is best here.
